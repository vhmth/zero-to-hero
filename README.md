All my notebooks and code following Karpathy's legendary deep learning course:

## All my notes
I have taken notes on the lectures and for almost all of the papers with my iPad.
You can find those notes here:

## What about GPT-2?
For the final course, I decided to push myself and build GPT-2 from scratch and not
watch the video until after I was already training the model. Because of that, you
won't find the course notebook and code.

Instead, you can see my implementation of GPT-2 here:
